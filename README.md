# Computer Vision Course Homeworks (Implementation source codes)
Welcome to my Computer Vision (CV) course homework repository! This repository contains my solutions and implementations of homework assignments from the fall 2022 semester at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT). I had the privilege of learning from Professor R. Safabakhsh and excelled in the implementation aspect of the course, achieving the highest scores.

## Overview

In this course, I delved into the fascinating world of Computer Vision. I worked on various assignments that enhanced my understanding of image & video manipulation, enhancement, understanding, and analysis. The repository showcases my efforts and solutions throughout the semester.

## Course Structure

The Computer Vision course comprised the following components:

- **Homework Assignments**: There were eight homework(project) assignments, each covering different topics and challenges related to computer vision. These assignments helped me develop practical skills in implementing computer vision techniques.

- **Final Thesis**: The final thesis on single-stage object detection required me to read, study, understand, write a technical report, and present the top five papers related to this topic. Each student was assigned a different topic, so their technical reports and presentations covered a wide range of computer vision research. 

- **Examinations**: The course included only a final exam to assess my theoretical understanding of the subject.
